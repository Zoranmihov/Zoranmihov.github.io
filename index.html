                A MERN stack E-Commerce website meant for small businesses.
                Having an internet presence can lead to a boost in sales, and
                every business no matter it's size should have one. That's why
                I've built this amazon like e-commerce website which allows
                buyers to leave feedback and ratings on the sold products, a
                sandbox payment system with Stripe and an admin profile, so
                the owner can edit, delete or create new products which are
                sold.

                money donated. The purpose of building this was to teach
                myself about proper authentication and security combined with
                implementing two of the internet's most famous online payments
                systems Paypal and Stripe.
